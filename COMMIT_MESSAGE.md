# Signal iOS: Development Environment Setup and Duplicate Content Detection

## Overview

This commit implements two key features in the Signal iOS application:

1. **Development Environment Setup** - Configures the Ruby environment, project run commands, and database connections
2. **Duplicate Content Detection System** - Implements a comprehensive system to detect and prevent blocked or duplicate content using AWS DynamoDB

## Development Environment Setup

* **Ruby Environment**:
  * Set Ruby version to 3.2.2 using rbenv
  * Installed bundler and project gems

* **Project Configuration**:
  * Added `.1024` file with:
    * Run command: `open Signal.xcworkspace`
    * Dependency command: `make dependencies`

* **Database Configuration**:
  * Created `User.xcconfig` with connection parameters:
    * PostgreSQL configuration (host, port, user, password)
    * Redis configuration (host, port, authentication)

## Duplicate Content Detection System

### New Components

1. **AWSConfig.swift**:
   * Implemented secure AWS authentication using Cognito Identity Pool
   * Configured DynamoDB connections with proper timeout handling
   * Added exponential backoff for retries

2. **GlobalSignatureService.swift**:
   * Created centralized service for DynamoDB interactions
   * Implemented hash checking with enhanced retry logic
   * Added idempotent hash storage with proper TTL management

3. **AttachmentDownloadHook.swift**:
   * Created hook to validate attachments before download
   * Implemented secure hash computation using SHA-256
   * Added reporting mechanism for blocked attachments

4. **AttachmentDownloadRetryRunner.swift**:
   * Implemented background monitoring of previously blocked attachments
   * Added exponential backoff for retry attempts
   * Created efficient database observers for state changes

### Modified Components

1. **MessageSender+Errors.swift**:
   * Added proper error handling for blocked duplicate content
   * Implemented user-friendly error messages

2. **MessageSender.swift**:
   * Added pre-send validation against local and global hash databases
   * Implemented post-send hash contribution to global database
   * Added asynchronous hash storage after successful sends

3. **AppDelegate.swift**:
   * Added AWS credential initialization during app launch
   * Implemented AttachmentDownloadHook installation
   * Added error handling for AWS connectivity issues

### Testing Components

1. **AWSMockClient.swift**:
   * Created mock implementation of AWSDynamoDB for unit testing
   * Added simulated database with in-memory storage
   * Implemented request delay and error simulation

2. **Unit Tests**:
   * GlobalSignatureServiceTests.swift
   * AttachmentDownloadHookTests.swift
   * AttachmentDownloadRetryRunnerTests.swift
   * DuplicateContentDetectionTests.swift (integration tests)

## Security Considerations

* Using AWS Cognito Identity Pool for secure, temporary credentials
* Only storing content hashes, not actual content
* Implementing default-allow policy for error cases
* Adding exponential backoff for service retries
* Including comprehensive error reporting without exposing sensitive data

## Documentation

* Created implementation_summary.txt with component overview
* Added duplicate_detection_results.md with detailed validation
* Updated project_validation_report.md with system status

## Performance Optimization

* Implemented asynchronous operations to prevent blocking the main thread
* Added optimized DynamoDB requests with proper indexing
* Included proper memory management with weak references
* Added task cancellation to prevent resource leaks

This commit provides a complete, production-ready duplicate content detection system with comprehensive test coverage and proper development environment configuration.
