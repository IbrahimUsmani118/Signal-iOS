• A new and improved interface for voice and video calls. Dial a friend without jumping through as many hoops, even though there still might be multiple rings.
• Easily start a video call with a new shortcut that's a more visible way to be visible.
• Picture-in-picture support within the app keeps your Signal calls in focus even if you focus on another conversation. It isn't multitasking if they still have your undivided attention.
• Quickly see details like mute status and timers in the conversation header so you don't need to keep them in your head.
• iPad users with a Magic Keyboard can make more magic happen with the trackpad, like swiping to dismiss a photo in the media view.
• Less is more when you press "Read More." Long messages now expand within the thread itself instead of taking you to a separate screen.
