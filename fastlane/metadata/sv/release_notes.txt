• We still have more improvements in the works, but the conversation scrolling enhancements in this release will make you feel like such a "Smooth Operator" that you're basically performing an unofficial cover of Sade's hit song from 1984.
• Numerous bugs in conversation search have vanished without a trace, including one that made it impossible to find results for single Chinese characters.
• Search results are better organized to make things easier to find. If you are looking for a group named "Hi" it will no longer get buried by every single message where someone said hello.
• Animated GIF search results now show up in a jiffy (even though that isn't how GIF is pronounced).
