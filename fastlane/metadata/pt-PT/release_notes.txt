• Now you can add stickers to pictures in the media editor to make them truly stick out. Put another bumper sticker on a picture of a car, add some sticker shock to a screenshot of Taylor Swift ticket prices, or spice up a photo of last night's dinner with a sticker of a pot sticker. And if you happen to live in the village of Sticker in South West England, you can find your favorite local wall and attach a sticker to its picture to become a virtual bill sticker in Sticker.
• Show them the time of your life with new stickers in the media editor that let you add stylized time decorations on outgoing images too.
