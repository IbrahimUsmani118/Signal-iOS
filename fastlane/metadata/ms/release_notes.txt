• We added a new (and optional) List mode in the All Media view. If you decide to go off the grid, now you can see more info at a glance, including file names, file sizes, dates, etc.
• This release also includes several performance improvements and startup speed enhancements. If you have a lot of large conversations, or a lot of messages, we hope that you’ll notice a little difference.
