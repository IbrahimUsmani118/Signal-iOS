• 미디어와 아바타 뷰어의 애니메이션을 개선하여 큰 그림으로 원활하게 전환할 수 있도록 만들었습니다.
• Share more things from more places. The share extension now has better support for the text format that various popular news apps share by default. We also squashed a bug that sometimes caused your first attempt to share something to fail.

• We fixed a couple of layout issues that could cause buttons to show up in the wrong place on new iPhones, like invisible castaways marooned underneath Apple's Dynamic Island.
• This update also includes support for Cantonese.
