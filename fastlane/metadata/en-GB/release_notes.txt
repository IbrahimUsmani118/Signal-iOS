• We added an iconic new way to customize the look of Signal. Choose from a fun selection of fresh app icon options and colors to change how Signal will appear on your home screen (Signal Settings > Appearance > App Icon).
• The attachment selector has a brand-new design that is more compact and easier to use. If you start feeling attached to these improvements right away, that's OK because it's thematically appropriate.
• For those of you who don't like AM or PM, it's time to smile. Now when your system settings are configured to display a 24-hour clock, the clock stickers in the media editor will be in 24-hour format too.
