• We added support for custom nicknames and notes for anyone you're chatting with on Signal, even if they aren't in your system contacts. Whether you're adding the missing letters in a lazy friend's profile name, or a reminder about where you met, notes and nicknames provide a convenient and secure way to jot down additional details about your Signal Connections — and they're end-to-end encrypted and protected by your Signal PIN so they can be securely restored if you lose your phone too.
