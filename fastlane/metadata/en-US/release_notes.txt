• Message reactions now support the latest emoji, so you can express your disbelief with "Shaking Face" or react with a "Pea Pod" when someone asks you how close you are to your friends.
• We added a new (and optional) List mode in the All Media view. If you decide to go off the grid, now you can see more info at a glance, including file names, file sizes, dates, etc.
