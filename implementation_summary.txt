Implementation Summary for Duplicate Content Detection System:

1. AWSConfig.swift: Updated to use secure Cognito authentication for DynamoDB access
2. AppDelegate.swift: Modified to initialize AWS credentials during app launch
3. MessageSender.swift: Updated to store attachment hashes after successful sends
4. GlobalSignatureService.swift: Improved with better error handling and retry logic
5. AttachmentDownloadHook.swift: Used to validate attachments before download
6. AttachmentDownloadRetryRunner.swift: Added to handle retry logic for previously blocked downloads

The system now securely validates attachments against a global hash database before downloading, and contributes hashes from successful sends to improve the global database.
