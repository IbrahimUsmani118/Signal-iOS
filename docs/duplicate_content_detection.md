# Duplicate Content Detection System

## Overview

The duplicate content detection system is designed to prevent the distribution of duplicate or harmful content across the Signal platform. It uses AWS DynamoDB to store and check content signatures, providing a scalable and efficient solution for content deduplication.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **AWSManager**: Core service handling AWS interactions
   - Manages AWS credentials
   - Handles DynamoDB operations
   - Provides content signature generation and checking

2. **DynamoDB Table**: `ImageSignatures`
   - Stores content signatures
   - Uses signature as primary key
   - Includes timestamp for cleanup operations

3. **CloudWatch Monitoring**
   - Alarms for high read/write capacity
   - SNS notifications for system alerts

### Flow

1. **Content Upload**:
   - Content is received by the application
   - Signature is generated using SHA-256
   - Signature is checked against DynamoDB
   - If not found, content is allowed and signature is stored
   - If found, content is blocked

2. **Content Download**:
   - Similar process to upload
   - Signatures are checked before allowing download

## Security Considerations

1. **Credential Management**
   - AWS credentials are stored in environment variables
   - Regular credential rotation is required
   - IAM policies follow principle of least privilege

2. **Data Protection**
   - Only content signatures are stored, not the content itself
   - Signatures are one-way hashes, cannot be reversed
   - DynamoDB table is encrypted at rest

3. **Access Control**
   - IAM policies restrict access to necessary DynamoDB operations
   - No direct access to AWS resources from client applications

## Performance

1. **Scaling**
   - DynamoDB auto-scaling enabled
   - Read/write capacity units monitored
   - CloudWatch alarms for capacity thresholds

2. **Optimization**
   - Efficient signature generation
   - Batch operations where possible
   - Caching of frequently accessed signatures

## Limitations

1. **False Positives**
   - Different content may generate same signature (extremely rare)
   - System may block legitimate content in edge cases

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Additional latency for content upload/download
   - Network dependency for signature checking

3. **Storage**
   - DynamoDB table size grows with unique content
   - Regular cleanup of old signatures required

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AWS Connection Issues**
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify IAM permissions
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor DynamoDB capacity
   - Check CloudWatch metrics
   - Review signature generation process

3. **False Positives**
   - Verify signature generation
   - Check for hash collisions
   - Review content processing

### Monitoring

1. **CloudWatch Metrics**
   - DynamoDB read/write capacity
   - Error rates
   - Latency metrics

2. **Logging**
   - AWSManager logs operations
   - Error tracking
   - Performance metrics

## Maintenance

1. **Regular Tasks**
   - Monitor DynamoDB table size
   - Review CloudWatch alarms
   - Rotate AWS credentials
   - Clean up old signatures

2. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Regular DynamoDB table backups
   - Disaster recovery procedures
   - Data retention policies
