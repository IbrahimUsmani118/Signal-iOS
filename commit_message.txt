feat(aws): Implement comprehensive AWS service validation system for duplicate content detection

This commit enhances the duplicate content detection system with improved AWS 
integration, advanced error handling, and comprehensive validation features:

- AWS configuration changes:
  - Updated region from us-west-2 to us-east-1 for consistency
  - Updated DynamoDB table name to "SignalContentHashes"
  - Updated Identity Pool ID to match aws-config.json
  - Added API Gateway endpoint configuration for different operations

- Added AWSCredentialsVerificationManager:
  - Implements robust service validation with singleton pattern
  - Provides both async/await and completion handler interfaces
  - Performs multi-level verification (identity, connectivity, table structure)
  - Implements detailed diagnostic reporting capabilities

- Enhanced GlobalSignatureService error handling:
  - Implemented improved exponential backoff with jitter
  - Added categorization of retryable vs terminal errors
  - Added configurable retry policies with capped maximum delay
  - Enhanced idempotency for hash operations

- AppDelegate integration:
  - Updated initialization flow with proper AWS service verification
  - Added graceful degradation when services are unavailable
  - Implemented structured logging of AWS service status

- Added APIGatewayClient for endpoint interaction:
  - Implemented configurable retry logic for HTTP operations
  - Added proper error classification and handling
  - Added support for different API Gateway endpoints

- Added comprehensive test and validation components:
  - Created verification tests for AWS credentials, DynamoDB, and API Gateway
  - Added mock implementations for unit testing
  - Implemented test scripts for component validation
  - Added diagnostic reporting functionality

These improvements provide a more robust, reliable integration with AWS
services for the duplicate content detection system while gracefully
handling service disruptions to maintain core app functionality.
