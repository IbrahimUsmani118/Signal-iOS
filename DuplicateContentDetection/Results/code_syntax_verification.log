# Code Syntax Verification

Date: Wed Apr 30 10:10:45 PM EDT 2025

## Files Checked

- GlobalSignatureService.swift - ✅ No obvious syntax errors detected
- AWSCredentialsVerificationManager.swift - ✅ No obvious syntax errors detected

## Findings

Code appears to be syntactically correct in both main implementation files.

NOTE: Due to environment limitations, full compilation tests could not be performed.

Recommendation: Run a full build within Xcode environment to validate complete project compilation.
