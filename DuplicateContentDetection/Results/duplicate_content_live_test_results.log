------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR DETAILS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Error in "Error Handling and Recovery" test:
   - Issue: The system was not able to recover from simulated DynamoDB throttling after 3 retries.
   - Impact: May cause temporary failures in hash storage or checks during high traffic periods.
   - Recommendation: Enhance the exponential backoff strategy in GlobalSignatureService to better 
     handle ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. Consider implementing circuit-breaker pattern.

2. Warning in "Performance Under Load" test:
   - Issue: Significant latency increase (139%) observed under heavy load.
   - Impact: May lead to poor user experience during peak usage.
   - Recommendation: Consider adding client-side caching of recent check results to reduce
     redundant DynamoDB calls. Evaluate DynamoDB capacity mode (provisioned vs on-demand).

All tests completed. Success rate: 5/6 (83.3%)
